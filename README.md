BoardGameCreator (C#)
================

A WPF application to be used by Board Game designers to easily create designs to help with getting pieces printed and sent to publishers or manufacturers.

This started as a small project to help supplement board game design, easily allowing for the creation of images from a backing set of data.  This allows for the rapid
creation and modification of board game objects.  Want to redesign a card layout, but dread redesigning 200 cards? No problem. Just update the template.

Changelog:
================
Version 0.01 - Most base classes and interfaces stubbed out, but work still needs done implementing the drawing and creation of designs.

Notes:
================
This application is currently abandoned.  If you would like to take ownership of it, please send an email to akw5013 at gmail dot com.
